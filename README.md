# GOW

*Go weather*

---

A simple command-line weather forecast app ported from [CSW](https://github.com/Deluxo/CSW).
Not all functionality is identical, but works just as well.


You can use `gow --help` to get the usage information.

### Instalation

`go get github.com/deluxo/gow` or clone the repo and build it yourself.
